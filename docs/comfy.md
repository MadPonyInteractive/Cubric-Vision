# ComfyUI Integration

ComfyUI is the generation engine. Communication is via REST + WebSocket.

## comfyController (`js/services/comfyController.js`)

Singleton that manages the ComfyUI server lifecycle and workflow execution.

- `ensureServerRunning()`: Starts ComfyUI if not running (calls `POST /comfy/start`).
- `queuePrompt(workflow, prompt)`: Enqueues a workflow via REST.
- `runWorkflow(workflowFile, params, onProgress?)`: Loads workflow JSON, uploads input assets, injects params by node `_meta.title`, captures `Output` node results via WebSocket.
- `interrupt()`: Aborts running generation.
- `generateRandomSeed()`: Returns a random seed for the Seed node.

## commandExecutor (`js/services/commandExecutor.js`)

Orchestrates a full generation request.

- `runCommand(commandKey, modelId, params, ctx, onProgress?)`: Resolves workflow file, builds title-keyed param map, runs via comfyController, captures Output node.
- `runAutoMask(imageData, modelId, params, onProgress?)`: Runs auto-mask workflow, captures both `Detected` and `Output` nodes.
- `_depFilename(depId)`: Maps dep ID to filename.
- `_resolveWorkflowFile(commandKey, modelId)`: Returns workflow JSON path.
- `_buildParams(commandKey, params, ctx)`: Builds the title→value map for injection.

## Workflow Injection Pattern

Nodes are matched by `_meta.title` (case-insensitive). Example:

```javascript
const params = {
    "Positive": "A landscape",
    "Seed": 45678,
    "Checkpoint": "sdxl-realistic.safetensors",
    "Lora_1": { lora_name: "my_lora.safetensors", strength_model: 0.8, strength_clip: 0.8 },
    "Input_Image": "data:image/png;base64,..."
};
```

Known titles: "Positive", "Negative", "Seed", "Checkpoint", "Lora_1"…"Lora_6", "Input_Image", "Input_Mask", "Output", "Detected", "Upscale_Model", etc. See `.claude/rules/comfy_injection.md` for the full table.

**Static filenames for uploads** (e.g. `mpi_detailer_input.png`) enable ComfyUI execution caching.

## assetService (`js/services/assetService.js`)

Loads available LoRA and upscale model filenames from `GET /comfy/list-files` into `state.availableLoras` and `state.upscaleModels`. Called lazily on ModelSettings open.
