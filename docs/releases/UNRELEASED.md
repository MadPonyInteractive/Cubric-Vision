# Unreleased — pending notes for the next version bump

> Scratchpad for changelog items accumulated between releases. When running
> `/mpi-version-bump`, fold every item below into the new

> archival `docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-v<newVersion>.md`, then clear this file

## fixes

- Fixed a missing LoRA (its folder removed from Settings) showing the crash-report dialog instead of a clear "not found in your LoRA folders" notice, and no longer leaving the queue stuck with an unresponsive Stop button.
