# Unreleased — pending notes for the next version bump

> Scratchpad for changelog items accumulated between releases. When running
> `/mpi-version-bump`, fold every item below into the new
> `RELEASE_NOTES['<newVersion>']` entry in `js/data/releaseNotes.js` and the
> archival `docs/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-v<newVersion>.md`, then clear this file
> back to the header.
>
> **Cleared 2026-08-15 after 1.4.2 shipped.** All nine items (4 new + 5 fixes) were
> folded into `RELEASE_NOTES['1.4.2']` and `docs/releases/2026-08-15-v1.4.2.md`.
>
> **Cleared 2026-08-11 after 1.4.1 shipped.** All nine bullets (1 new + 8 fixes)
> were folded into `RELEASE_NOTES['1.4.1']` and
> `docs/releases/2026-08-11-v1.4.1.md`, including the first-run entry an earlier
> commit (`e2b0ddbf`) had filed for 1.5.0 — Fabio retargeted the whole scratchpad
> at the patch, because nothing pending was a feature.
>
> **The reset is part of the bump and it got missed in 1.4.0** — the fold ran, the
> clear did not, which would have re-folded all of 1.4.0 into the next version and
> shipped every bullet twice. If you are folding a release and this file still holds
> the last one's items, that is the bug, not a backlog.
>
> **Before writing a "used to / previously / no longer" claim, check it against the
> last released tag** (`git show v<prev>:<path>`), per bullet. Code that changed two
> or three times inside one unreleased version reads like user-visible history but
> never shipped, and the entry is then simply false. Full gate:
> `.claude/skills/mpi-release/references/copy-review.md` § Gate 0.

## Important changes

_(none yet)_

## What's new

- Head Swap boxes can now leave the picture, and grow past it. The square you draw around a
  head may sit beyond the image edge and stretch up to the picture's longest side, so a head
  near a border — or tall hair, or a neck tattoo — can be taken in without the box swallowing
  whoever is standing next to them. The reference head is padded back to square before the
  model sees it, and the picture you get back is untouched: no border strip.

## Fixes

- The first engine start no longer looks frozen. Setting up a new engine installs a large set of
  Python packages before ComfyUI can start, and for the minutes that took, the window only said
  "Starting ComfyUI Engine…" — no progress, no explanation, so it read as a hang. That step now
  names itself, "Installing Python packages… First engine start only", and hands over to
  "Starting ComfyUI Engine…" the moment it finishes. Later starts skip the step entirely, as they
  always did.

- The app no longer keeps running outdated engine components after an update. Anyone who had
  used "Skip the local engine install" kept that setting even after an engine was installed,
  and it quietly switched off the check that repairs out-of-date components — so a fixed or
  improved component could sit unused indefinitely, with nothing reported. The setting now
  clears itself once an engine is present, and is greyed out while one is installed.

- "Run locally" is now honoured everywhere, not just on the Cue button. With a cloud Pod
  connected and the toggle switched on, continuing a preview, finishing a preview, and the
  History workspace's own image, video and resize tools all still sent the job to the Pod —
  so a generation needing something only your own machine has could fail on the cloud engine
  while the app showed it was running locally. The queue chip disagreed too, reading REMOTE
  next to a local toggle. Every dispatch path now reads the one setting.

- Connecting to a cloud Pod no longer claims to have installed models it did not. Every
  connect announced one "<Model> installed." message per model already on the volume — six
  at a time, with nothing downloaded — plus a raw internal job name, "engine:node-drift
  installed.". A background repair that runs once per connect was being mistaken for a
  download, and when the window was in the background each one also became a desktop
  notification. Those repairs are now silent, as they were always meant to be; a real
  install still tells you, including one that completes as a side-effect of another.

- Live latent previews now play everywhere they appear. The Flow result pane replayed
  the whole clip at burst speed on every sampler step and then froze, the History
  workspace showed nothing at all on a video run, and the minimised preview window sat
  on a single still frame. All four surfaces now share one player and pace the clip at
  the rate it announces.
